# Example Videos for Digital Twin in ROS 2

In this repository, we keep example videos to showcase the use of Digital Twin in ROS 2, as described in the paper: **Synchronizing a collaborative armâ€™s digital twin in real-time**.

As we prepare for public launch of the code repository, we'll update this repository with additional videos.
